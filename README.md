# About
This utility copies source files and pastes them into one big text file with a comment noting the path of each file.
I built this as an easy way to upload a project as one file to an LLM so I can ask questions about the whole project.
Currently it recursively searches for just .rs files. I plan to add support for more types of codebases as I need it.
